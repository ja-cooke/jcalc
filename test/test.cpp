// This entry point calls main inside of unit_test.hpp
// All test modules are contained in cpp files using the same naming
// structure as the source code files with the prefix "test_":
// test_<filename>.cpp
//
// This file is reserved for unit tests for the file main.cpp. However, these
// are not expected to be required by design.
